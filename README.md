# Getting-Started-with-NLP-coursera-assignment-
This project helps to understand the basics of sentiment analysis using nltk to process the data and logistic regression like a model to use.  
I really recommand the course Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces but if you can't afford it take a look to the assignment to have an idea.
